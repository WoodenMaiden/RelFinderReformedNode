# Important
- [x] Test if graph is completely fetch 
- [ ] :bangbang: Finish depth first search

# To do ASAP
- [ ] Fully switch to ES6 syntax
- [ ] Logging System
- [ ] 

# Misc
- [ ] Try to not nuke the endpoint by getting triples

## Ideas:
- Maybe load relations of input entities recursively, up to a certain depth and join them
- Try to take the smallest number of graphs possible and the smallest in terms of sizes

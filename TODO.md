# Important
- [x] Test if graph is completely fetch 
- [x] :bangbang: Try to not nuke the endpoint by getting triples
  - - [x] Test it!
- [x] :bangbang: Finish depth first search
- [x] :bangbang: Debug kosaraju algorithm: some SCCs seems to not be strongly connected, some are strictly the same and some are equal to 0 and yet are present in the list
- [ ] refactor exception throwing and error messages


# to do ASAP
- [x] Connect SCCs between them
- [ ] Implement RDFGraph.multipleKosaraju()


# To do someday
- [x] ~~Fully switch to ES6 syntax~~
- [ ] Switch to ESNext syntax
- [x] Logging System
- [ ] Switch to async/await

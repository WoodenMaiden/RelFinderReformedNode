# Important
- [x] Test if graph is completely fetch 
- [x] :bangbang: Try to not nuke the endpoint by getting triples
  - - [ ] Test it!
- [ ] :bangbang: Finish depth first search

# To do ASAP
- [ ] Fully switch to ES6 syntax
- [ ] Logging System

## Ideas:
- :heavy_check_mark: Maybe load relations of input entities recursively, up to a certain depth and join them
- ~~Try to take the smallest number of graphs possible and the smallest in terms of sizes~~
